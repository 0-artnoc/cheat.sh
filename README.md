```

## Search

To search for a keyword, use the query:

```
    /~keyword
```

In this case search is not recursive â€” it is conducted only in a pages of the specified level.
For example:

```
    /~snapshot          look for snapshot in the first level cheat sheets 
    /scala/~currying     look for currying in scala cheat sheets
```

For a recursive search in all cheat sheets, use double slash:

```
    /~snapshot/r         look for snapshot in all cheat sheets
```

You can use special search options after the closing slash:

```
    /~shot/bi           case insensitive (i), word boundaries (b)
```

List of search options:

```
    i   case insensitive search
    b   word boundaries
    r   recursive search
```

## How to add a cheat sheet

If you want to add a cheat sheet, you have one of the following
ways:

* Add it to one of the external cheat sheets repositories; you should decide on your own what is the best repository for your cheat sheet;
* Add it to the local cheat.sh repository ([cheat.sheets](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sheets)) on github (fork, commit, pull request);
* Post it on cheat.sh using curl or a web browser ([cheat.sh/:post](http://cheat.sh/:post)).

If you want to change an existing cheat sheet,
you have to find the original repository (when you open a cheat sheet in a browser,
you see the repository's github button in the bottom of the cheat sheet),
the cheat sheet is coming from, and change it there.
After some time the changes will be synchronized on cheat.sh.
